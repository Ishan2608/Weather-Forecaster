# Weather-Forecaster
A weather forecasting web application built by Nodejs. It utilizes a third party API - from OpeanWeather.
I created this project while pursuing my web development course on Udemy, taught by Angela Yu.
I have added dynamic content feature myself, learning about numeruos Nodejs concepts from documentation and StackOverflow.
